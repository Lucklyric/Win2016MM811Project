## Getting started

The best way to start developing this project is to set up a virtualenv and install the requirements.

    git clone <my remote url/sodapy.git>
    cd sodapy
    virtualenv venv_sodapy
    source venv_sodapy/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run tests to confirm that everything is set up properly.

    ./runtests tests/

## Other considerations

- Please review the open issues before opening a PR.
- Significant changes or new features should be documented in [`README.md`](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy/blob/master/README.md).
- Writing tests is never a bad idea. Make sure all tests are passing before opening a PR.
